# Rotten Soup Roguelike

A roguelike written in JavaScript with [rot.js](http://ondras.github.io/rot.js/hp/).
Currently in early development and I have created my own representation of a
game map in [utils.js](/apps/roguelike/utils.js). I used [Tiled](http://www.mapeditor.org/)
map editor in order to create some static maps and exported them in a json
format, then converted them to my game's map representation; parsing game mobs
and environmental obstacles on the way.
