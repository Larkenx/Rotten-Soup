# Rotten Soup - Playable at [larkenx.net](http://larkenx.net)!

Rotten Soup is roguelike written in JavaScript with [rot.js](http://ondras.github.io/rot.js/hp/). My goal was to create a really robust
data representation for all game entities - from the map, individual tiles, and actors. I used [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/) to build a reactive UI, which made displaying game information very easy. In the [v1.0.0 release](https://github.com/Larkenx/Rotten-Soup/releases/tag/v1.0) of Rotten Soup, I used bare-bones JQuery and W3CSS to update game information to the UI, but it was clunky and in desperate need of a template engine!
