While maintaining some roots in traditional roguelike gameplay with features like randomly generated dungeons, turn-based combat and permadeath, Rotten Soup also has many modern features such as tiled graphics, animations, a statically defined overworld, and mouse controls. Since Rotten Soup is developed using JavaScript, you can play it in your browser [here](https://rottensoup.herokuapp.com)!
