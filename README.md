# Rotten Soup
###### A roguelike written in JavaScript with [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/), [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/), [rot.js](http://ondras.github.io/rot.js/hp/) and [PixiJS](http://www.pixijs.com/).

While maintaining some roots in traditional roguelike gameplay with features like randomly generated dungeons, turn-based combat and permadeath, Rotten Soup also has many modern features such as tiled graphics, animations, a statically defined overworld, and mouse controls. Since Rotten Soup is developed using JavaScript, you can play it in your browser [here](https://rottensoup.herokuapp.com)!
